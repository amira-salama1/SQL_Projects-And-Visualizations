This is a Dashboard that features P&L Statement in an advanced Table Context:

Also a supporting Tutorial [Link](https://rosariogaunag.wordpress.com/2023/09/05/profit-loss-advanced-table/) to Rosario's blog, in which she explains how to build this Dashboard:

* Customize the Subtotals name tag, without the need to duplicate the data.
* Customize whether, for display and presentation purposes in the P&L, the negative sign of negative amounts is shown or hidden.
* Customize the type of font to be used in the Subtotal rows.
* Customize the shading of the Subtotals rows.
* Add lines between the rows of the P&L.

**What is Awesome about this Viz:**
Sure all the above points, also a trick that was used to constrain Table Ratio (in tha Analysis Menu > Table Layout), the trick is to use a numeric Axis, Vs other Data types (Date Axis was Used) to See the Whole text of  the Categories in the P&L St.
