[#WOW](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2023-w15/) 2023 Week 15 | Power BI: What-if parameters inspired by Makeover Monday

Using a Makeover Monday dataset that was inspired by Andy Kriebel, that Dashboard/Report features a dynamic parameter representing how many cups of Coffee a day a person can drink, 
based on that, the Bar Chart updates the sum of Milligrams of Caffiene for different coffee chains (e.g Costa , Starbucks .. etc) .

Also the Bars change Color depending on the total amount of Caffiene Vs the Recommended Amount by U.S. Food & Drug Admin.
