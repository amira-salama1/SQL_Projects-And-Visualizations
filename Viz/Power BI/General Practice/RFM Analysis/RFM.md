This Dahsboard features RFM Analysis using Power BI

It includes 3 tabs/sheets using button navigation:
* Demographic sheet
* Segmentation
* Customer Details

Also, has some details sheet about the Segmentations' logic and recommended steps to be taken to retain customers


The approach is to divide the dataset of customers into 11 categories using the percentile function in Power BI.

The segmentation includes:

1- Champions (scoring the highest value in the RFM analysis, sum of values >=13 and RFM scores are in values 4 & 5 )

2- Loyals (Second Best sum of values are high as well and RFM scores are between values 3 & 5 )
