Inspiration & credits for this project: [CUSTOMER ANALYTICS || RFM CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE-zMYRrZCs&ab_channel=ChiamakaIgwe) YouTube Video

This Dahsboard features RFM Analysis using Power BI

It includes 3 tabs/sheets using button navigation:
* Demographic sheet
* Segmentation
* Customer Details

Also, has some details sheet about the Segmentations' logic and recommended steps to be taken to retain customers


The approach is to divide the dataset of customers into categories using the percentile function in Power BI.

The segmentation divides the dataset into 5 partitions and scores each customer aggregated measures ( Recency, Frequency & Monetary) 
highest frequency & monetary gets a high score of 5 and opposite for recency.

However according to the "Marketing Analytics_ A Practical Guide to Real Marketing Science" Book By **Mike Grigsby**, RFM is a Financial Analysis that doesn't explain a Customer's behavior, RFM works, as a method of finding those most engaged, doesn't explain the underlying motivations that caused the resultant actions.
