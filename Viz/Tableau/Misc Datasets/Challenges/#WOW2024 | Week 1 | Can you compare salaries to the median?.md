#WOW2024 | Week 1 | Can you compare salaries to the median?

This visualisation compares an employee’s actual salary against the median salary of all employees with the same pay level (cohort). 

Along with this, a salary scale determines how close that employee is to the median, and then provides an effective way of being able to see how employees in the same cohort compare – are there some departments that typically pay more than others; are there employees who may need a pay increase as they’re quite adrift?

What is awesome about this Viz:
* Ability to compare an Employee's salary to the Median within their cohort quickly with just a look at the View.
* The Tootltip provides more details & insights about the Pay, its percentage of the median and which number on the Salary scale
