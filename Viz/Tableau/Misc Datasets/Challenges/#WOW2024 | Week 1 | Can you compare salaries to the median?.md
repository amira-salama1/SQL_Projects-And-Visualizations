#WOW2024 | Week 1 | Can you compare salaries to the median?

This visualisation compares an employee’s actual salary against the median salary of all employees with the same pay level (cohort). 

Along with this, a salary scale determines how close that employee is to the median, and then provides an effective way of being able to see how employees in the same cohort compare – are there some departments that typically pay more than others; are there employees who may need a pay increase as they’re quite adrift?

What is awesome about this Viz:
* Ability to compare an Employee's salary to the Median within their cohort quickly with just a look at the View.
* The Tooltip provides more details & insights about the Pay, its percentage of the median and which number on the Salary scale

  The Salary Scale is a number from 1 to 6 :
  
1 : Salary is less than 80% of Median
  
2 : Salary is between 80-90% of Median

3 : Salary is between 90-100% of Median

4 : Salary is between 100-110% of Median

5 : Salary is between 110-120% of Median

6 : Salary is more than 120% of Median
