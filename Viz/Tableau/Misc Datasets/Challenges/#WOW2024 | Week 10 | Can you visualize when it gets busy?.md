Work in progress ... 

[#WOW2024 |W10 ](https://workout-wednesday.com/2024w10tab/) Can you visualize when it gets busy?.

* Anlayze data regarding the emergency room at a hospital and visualize when it gets busy.
The data records when patients arrived and how long they had to wait. From this data, we want to visualize how many patients were waiting in each 30-minute interval over a 24-hour period.

What is Awesome about this Viz:
* For starter it includes alot of challenges in one challenge.
* It Uses Data Densfication to count patients in the interim ranges (between 6:00 and 6:30 ðŸ•£ for example and then if the patient was still waiting, then they should be included in the next time range)
* The calculation done to create the relation between the main Data Source and the other data source with time ranges.


I should also refer to Donna Coles [Blog](https://donnacoles.home.blog/2024/03/07/can-you-visualise-when-it-gets-busy/), because I used her post to help me understand the Calculations.
