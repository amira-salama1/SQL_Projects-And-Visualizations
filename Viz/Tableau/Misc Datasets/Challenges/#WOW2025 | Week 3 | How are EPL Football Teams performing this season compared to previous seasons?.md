[#WOW2025](https://workout-wednesday.com/2025w03tab/) | Week 3 | How are EPL Football Teams performing this season compared to previous seasons?

So This Challenge by Donna Coles, is a 3 level Challenge for Beginners, Intermediate & Advanced Tableau Users

What is Awesome about this Viz:
* First off, I love football and was psyched to do this challenge for that
* Using Previous Value (Lookup function) in Tableau to flag the Row to capture the Value.
* At a glance you can compare current & past performance
