Drill-down Dashboard with Dynamic Zone Visibility

This Dashboard is inspired by : Andy Kriebel's Dashboard [Drill Down Dashboard | Next-Level Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.kriebel/viz/DrillDownDashboardNext-LevelTableau/DrillDown) with a few modifications that I've done.


What's Awesome about this Viz:
* Controling which measure you can see on the line Trend Chart by Clicking on any of the Measures/KPIs.
* Being able to drill dowm to the details of the Customer by Measure and month, through clicking on a month on the line trend.
* Again benefiting from the Dynamic Zone visibility functionality to show or hide the customers' Details window
