Drilldown Dashboard with Dynamic Zone Visibility

This Dashboard is inspired by : Andy Kriebel's Dashboard [Drill Down Dashboard | Next-Level Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.kriebel/viz/DrillDownDashboardNext-LevelTableau/DrillDown) with a few changeds that I've done


What's Awesome about this Viz:
* Controling which measure you can see on teh line Trend
* being able to drill dowm to the details of the Customer by Measure and month, through clicking on a month on te trend line.
* Again benefiting from the Dynamic Zone visibility functionality to show or hide the Details window
