Following up in the same Project of Customizing Tableau Filters  by [Ken Flerlage ](https://www.flerlagetwins.com/2023/08/custom-filters.html), this is Project 2

The Dashboard is also inspired by [Rosario Gauna](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rgauna/viz/HierarchyUXFilterUIStyles-Example2/Example02) Tableau Visionary & Tableau Public Ambassador
 
Also a [Link](https://rosariogaunag.wordpress.com/2023/12/13/part-2-hierarchical-selection-menus-ux-ui/) Tutorial on how she created the **Customized Filter**. 

What is Awesome about this Viz?
* Building on the first experience, instead of a Single select or Select All months, this Dashboard leverages the use of Levels (Hierarchies) in the same data source, to select multiple or All Months as a filter
