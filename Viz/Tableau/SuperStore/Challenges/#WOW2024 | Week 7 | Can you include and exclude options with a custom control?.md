What is Awesome about this Viz:
* Parameter Actions with Contain (Function), that can accommodate multiple selections 
* The simplicity of the calculations that are straight forward and go beyond expectations.

DrawBacks:
* According to my opinion, the Top 5 States by Sales, if not selected then you have to manually change every state's color to white or the color of the background that is, I think there should be a dynamic wat to change this.
