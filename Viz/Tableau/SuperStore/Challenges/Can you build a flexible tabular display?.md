[#WOW2023](https://workout-wednesday.com/2023w41tab/) | Week 41 | Can you build a flexible tabular display?

This challenge balances that type of request by providing a flexible display that allows the user to choose between a visual or textual display, and a summarised or detailed view.

What is awesome about this Viz:

According to my opinion,  Is the ability to use Calculations to hide/unhide more details (in this Case Years Drill) horizontally. 

It also leverages the vertical container for the use of dynamic zone visibility
