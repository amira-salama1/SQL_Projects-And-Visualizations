WIP

This Week in [WOW](https://workout-wednesday.com/2024w14tab/) uses Map Layers to build a Trellis Chart of Profit ratio Gauges.

What is awesome about this Viz?
* it touches some geometric and trignometric concepts of circle calculations.

What is not cool about this Viz is:
* In my opinion, this Viz is more complicated than necessary, and due to that, the Performance of the dashboard became poor.
