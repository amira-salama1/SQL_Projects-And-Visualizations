[#WOW2023](https://workout-wednesday.com/2023w47tab/) W47 Can You Create A Monthly Driver Analysis


Compare 2 years of Superstore data, but our focus will be on Monthly Sales / Profit and the monthly Year-Over-Year change. Probably California is a high-Sales state, but is that where growth opportunities lie? We want to understand which States drove the YOY performance, showing a Rank based on their YOY increment in the end.

what is awesome about this viz: 

First of all It's a project:

* Inspired by real life  Customer's Demands
* It would typically take a bit of time and calculations to get to the final Viz.
* It leverages the use of parameter actions and jumping between home page for a summary view and drilling into details page for further info.

  In my opinion, this is one of the coolest dashboards I have imitated from #WOW challenges, it's fun to create and also expands my learning of Tableau.
