[#WOW2024](https://workout-wednesday.com/2024w05tab/) | Week 5 | Excel at Tableau Interactivity with Dynamic Zone Visibility

Requirements:
* Create a Map that shows one State at a time and plots each City, with their names labelled. There should be a Drop-Down menu to allow the user to select a State.
* Allow the user to select a City and create a mini-map which highlights the selected City using Size and Colour (##c30000)
* Create a Table which shows sales information for the selected City only. The Table should contain the following fields, including a Sub-Total for each Order ID:
**Customer Name
**Order ID
**Product Name
**Unit Price
**Quantity
**Sales
* Bringing it all together: The end user should be able to select a City on the main map to bring up a view that displays the mini-map and the Table, with a Title that reflects which City was selected. They should then have the option to close this view and return to the main map
