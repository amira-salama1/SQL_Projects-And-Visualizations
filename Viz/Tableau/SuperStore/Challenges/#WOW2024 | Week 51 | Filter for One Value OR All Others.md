Version 1
- 1 sheet
- Create a bar chart of Sales by Region and Category
- Colour the bars by Region (Central #c5b0d5, East #ffbb78,  South #81b29a, West #3d405b)
- Sort the bars in descending order by Sales
- Create a parameter to allow the user to select whether they want to view the West Region or All Other Regions (Not West)

   If ‘West’ is selected then only the West region should be displayed in the bar chart

  If ‘Not West’ is selected, then a second ‘filter’ should appear to allow the user to select which regions they want to view from the three that remain (Central, East, South)


Version 2:
  
  - Same Visual
  - Create a custom filter to allow the user to select which regions they want to see.
    
   If ‘West’ is selected then only the West region should be displayed in the bar chart. 
   
   In addition, the custom filter ‘radio button’ should only be filled for the ‘West’ region.
   
   If any other region is selected (Central, East or South) then the ‘radio button’ for ‘West’ should automatically be turn off 
   
   and users should be able to select and deselect from the three remaining regions. 
   
   The regions displayed in the bar chart should match the selection in the in the custom filter.

So for the Second challenge I followed the steps from [Donna + DataViz](https://donnacoles.home.blog/2024/12/19/filter-for-one-value-or-all-others/) blog to get it right, there was a similar post for a dynamic filter list done by [Rosario Gauna](https://rosariogaunag.wordpress.com/2023/12/13/part-2-hierarchical-selection-menus-ux-ui/) should definitely check that out
