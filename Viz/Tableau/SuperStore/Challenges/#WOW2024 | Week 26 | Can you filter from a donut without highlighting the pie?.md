This Week's [WOW](https://workout-wednesday.com/2024w26tab/) Challenge Kyle created a Donut chart that doesn't highlight when clicked on, 

Requirements:
* Create a donut chart showing Sales by Category, with a label of total sales inside the donut
* Create a second donut chart showing Sales by Sub-Category, with a label of distinct product count for the selected category
* Clicking on the Category chart should filter the Sub-Category chart to only the Sub-Categories in that Category
* When clicking the Category chart, the pie piece should not highlight at all
* Sub-Category colors gradient should align with Category colors
* No scaffolding or secondary datasets

What's awesome about this Viz:
* A trick used to stop the slices of the Donut/Pie Chart from appearing, this trick uses a "Dummy" Sheet, with a Polygon mark placed as a floating opject in the dashboard, that will stop the donut slices from appearing.
* The Filter action Trick taht uses True/False Values to stop the donut sheet from highlighting.
