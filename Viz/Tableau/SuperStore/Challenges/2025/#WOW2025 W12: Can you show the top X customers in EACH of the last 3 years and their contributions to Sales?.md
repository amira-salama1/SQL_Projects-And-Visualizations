[#WOW2025 W12](https://workout-wednesday.com/2025w12tab/): Can you show the top X customers in EACH of the last 3 years and their contributions to Sales?

What is awesome about this Viz?
- This Viz is an example of the [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) principle, which states that, "80% of sales come from 20% of clients".
- You can see the Impact of the Top number (Dynamic entry of the Top Customers) on sales, as a percentage or actual numbers
- Details can be shown also, using a parameter, that can Hide or show the Customers as a bar chart.
