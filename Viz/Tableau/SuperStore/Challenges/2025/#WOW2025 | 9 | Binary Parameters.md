Still a Work in Progress  

[#WOW2025](https://workout-wednesday.com/2025w9tab/) | 9 | Binary Parameters

Dashboard Requirements:

*  Create a bar chart of Sales by Subcategory.
* Create a dimension that ‘buckets’ subcategories and add that dimension to the color property.
* Set up an action that changes the bucket assignment.
    * When a mark in bucket 0 is clicked, it moves to bucket 1.
    * When a mark in bucket 1 is clicked it moves to bucket 0.

Note, if a mark is already selected, it might require an extra click!
This build involves one string parameter, with no sets or groups.
