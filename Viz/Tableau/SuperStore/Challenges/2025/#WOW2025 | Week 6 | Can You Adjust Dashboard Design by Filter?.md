This Dashboard features KPIs and a breakdown by Sub-Categories, allowing to filter by Category leveraging the Dynamic Zone Visibility feature in Tableau

I had a little help from [Donna Coles](https://donnacoles.home.blog/2025/02/07/can-you-adjust-the-dashboard-design-by-filter/) blog, and I also did a bit different formatting than the required one

What is Awesome about this Viz:

* Getting a common axis for the Sub-Categories to display without gaps, each in it's Category pane (loved that)
* Showing how flexible a dahsboard design can be, using Dynamic Zone Visibility.
