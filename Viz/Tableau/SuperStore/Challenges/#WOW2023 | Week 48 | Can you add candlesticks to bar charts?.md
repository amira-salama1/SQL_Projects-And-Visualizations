WOW2023 | Week 48 | Can you add candlesticks to bar charts?


Create a combination of bar charts and candles in one Chart/View.

Specs:
* Create bar charts by Sub-Category displaying selected measure of the latest year(current year) and selected year
* Create candlesticks which show the difference between 2 years
* Create 2 selector sheets: comparison year and measure name
 *** Note: When you click on a mark in the selector sheets, the mark should NOT remain selected
* Match labels and tooltips
 **Note: If the signs of the two year values are different, the difference % should be represented as “-“.
* No additional datasets
* Color: as you like

What's Awesome about this Viz:
  * The Bar chart represents the Values (Given a selected KPI and a given selected year), the Candlestick represents the YOY difference with percentages & increments
  it's easy to view and understand and also elegant and not cluttery.
  *  A trick to use an existing dimension in the Dataset instead of adding an additional Dataset to create the Buttons
