[#WOW2023](https://workout-wednesday.com/2023w50tab/) W50 - Can you build this simple KPI?.md

Week 50 of #WOW weekly challenge is about creating the Traditional KPI

Requirements:
* Dashboard size: 400 x 200
* 1 worksheet
* Show the sales from the most recent full month.
* Show the percent change from the same month the prior year.
* Include a sparkline that has the last 24 full months–this means no December.
* When you hover over a month in the sparkline, the kpi should show the sales for that month–and the correct percentage comparison.
* Include a dynamic label for month on the hover effect.
* Match the tooltips.

I added A dynamic Measure also to choose between Sales, Profit or Quantity

What is awesome about the Viz:

* The Use of LODs to go beyond the filter (as the Data is limited to 24 full months of Data).
* It's simplicity as a one view to see also and compare performance in the past year.
