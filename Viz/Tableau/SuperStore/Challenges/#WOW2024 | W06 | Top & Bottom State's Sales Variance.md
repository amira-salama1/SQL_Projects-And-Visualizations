[#WOW](https://bi.envaseconnect.cloud/#/site/EnvaseCustomerDiagnostics/home) | W06 | Top & Bottom States By Sales Variance (Prior Month Comparison)

Requirements
* 800 x 800
* Allow the user to select a month value
* Allow the user to select a top n value
* Display a bar chart showing ascending Sales variance from previous month by state for the selected month
* No LODs
* BONUS â€“ Can you solve this challenge WITHOUT using sets?

  What's Awesome about this Viz:
  * The Use of Combined Sets, to view the Top N States through Parameters.
  * Another method to view the States using calculations, I used the Rank Function.
