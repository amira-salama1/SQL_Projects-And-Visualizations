[#WOW2023](https://workout-wednesday.com/2023w42tab/) Week 42 | Can you proportionally brush from multi-selection?

Kyle Yetter : This weekâ€™s challenge is another inspired by my everyday work. As we launch new features, we look at how different segments of users engage with them. We wanted a smooth way to click into the segment combinations that were of interest, without having to go back to the top to change a bunch of filters

What is Awesome about this Viz:

In my opinion is the functionality the Dashboard offers & that's inspired by a real project.
Also in Kyle Yetter workbook, the Calculations are Simple and straight forward

Challenge is for me: the Breadcrumb Label Calculation
