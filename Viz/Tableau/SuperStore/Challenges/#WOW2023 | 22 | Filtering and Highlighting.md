Create a dashboard that shows KPIs and a trend of the selected KPI 
(KPI can be selected through clicking on the KPI e.g Show Sales Trend line according to the Date frame selected). 

* Allow the user to filter dates, change the period type and select a period within that type. The selected period values should be shown in KPIs vs total as well as highlighted on the trend chart.

  What is awesome anout this Viz:

  * It's based on a real-time project/demand
  * Allows the user to determine the granularity of the the Selected date in a dynamic way, showing the Current number Vs the Total Numbers in the given last years to compare.
