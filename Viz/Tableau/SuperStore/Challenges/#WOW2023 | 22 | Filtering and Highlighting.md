[#WOW2023](https://workout-wednesday.com/2023w22tab/) | 22 | Filtering and Highlighting

Create a dashboard that shows KPIs and a trend of the selected KPI 
(KPI can be selected through clicking on the KPI e.g Show Sales Trend line according to the Date frame selected). 

* Allow the user to filter dates, change the period type and select a period within that type. The selected period values should be shown in KPIs vs total as well as highlighted on the trend chart.
