[WOW Challenge](https://workout-wednesday.com/2024w20tab/) #WOW2024 | Week 20 | Can you combine categorical and sequential colors in the same chart?

I took Kyle's Idea, may be changed the formula a bit, but I thought the idea was reall great and straight forward, without crating two color legends or combining both


What I think is Awesome about this Viz:
 * Again, it's based on a Real-world scenario.
 * I've seen then done through 2 calculations one to get the colors for the green and yellow as a Dimension and then if it's in the gradient reds that will be another Calculation, but looking to the Author's Dashboard in Tableau Public, He got that in only one calculation, I thought it was pretty simple, Straight forward and great.
