An [Inverted Index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/inverted-index/) is a data structure used in information retrieval systems to efficiently retrieve documents or web pages containing a specific term or set of terms. In an inverted index, the index is organized by terms (words), and each term points to a list of documents or web pages that contain that term.
